# Neural Machine Translation Development

## Translation Automation Book 

This contains the official repository (mtdev) for supporting materials and resources for the book **"Translation Automation"**. This book and its accompanying resources are designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in the field of translation technology, with a special focus on Machine Translation (MT), Neural MT (NMT), and Large Language Models (LLMs).

"Translation Automation" examines the crucial role of translation technology in today's language services industry, with a spotlight on the transformative power of MT. The authors posit a simple but powerful stance: **knowledge is power**. By demystifying how translation technology, especially NMT and LLMs, works, the book aims to equip current and future generations of translation and humanities students, as well as industry practitioners, with the knowledge to make informed decisions about MT application and evaluation.

The narrative underscores the significance of understanding MT's appropriate use cases, its limitations, and the nuances of MT evaluation in the wake of the hype surrounding the advent of online NMT systems and LLMs. This comprehensive guide is intended for anyone interested in a deeper understanding of how modern translation technologies operate and those keen on exploring the practical aspects of building their own NMT system.

## adaptNMT

adaptNMT streamlines all processes involved in the development and deployment of RNN and Transformer neural translation models. As an open-source application, it is designed for both technical and non-technical users who work in the field of machine translation. Built upon the widely-adopted OpenNMT ecosystem, the application is particularly useful for new entrants to the field since the setup of the development environment and creation of train, validation  and test splits is greatly simplified. Graphing, embedded within the application, illustrates the progress of model training, and SentencePiece is used for creating subword segmentation models. Hyperparameter customization is facilitated through an intuitive user interface, and a single-click model development approach has been implemented. Models developed by adaptNMT can be evaluated using a range of metrics, and deployed as a translation service within the application. To support eco-friendly research in the NLP space, a green report also flags the power consumption and emissions generated during model development. The application is freely available.

## adaptMLLM

The advent of Multilingual Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has spawned innovation in many areas of natural language processing. Despite the exciting potential of this technology, its impact on developing high-quality Machine Translation (MT) outputs for low-resource languages remains relatively under-explored. Furthermore, an open-source application, dedicated to both fine-tuning MLLM and managing the complete MT workflow, remains unavailable. We aim to address these imbalances through the development of adaptMLLM which streamlines all processes involved in the fine-tuning of MLLMs for MT. As an open-source application, it is designed for developers, translators and end users who work in the field of MT. The application is particularly useful for new entrants to the field since the setup of the development environment is greatly simplified.
