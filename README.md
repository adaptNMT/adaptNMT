# Neural Machine Translation Development

Welcome to the official repository for supporting materials and resources for the book **"Translation Automation"**. This book and its accompanying resources are designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in the field of translation technology, with a special focus on Machine Translation (MT), Neural MT (NMT), and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## About the Book

"Translation Automation" examines the crucial role of translation technology in today's language services industry, with a spotlight on the transformative power of MT. The authors posit a simple but powerful stance: **knowledge is power**. By demystifying how translation technology, especially NMT and LLMs, works, the book aims to equip current and future generations of translation and humanities students, as well as industry practitioners, with the knowledge to make informed decisions about MT application and evaluation.

The narrative underscores the significance of understanding MT's appropriate use cases, its limitations, and the nuances of MT evaluation in the wake of the hype surrounding the advent of online NMT systems and LLMs. This comprehensive guide is intended for anyone interested in a deeper understanding of how modern translation technologies operate and those keen on exploring the practical aspects of building their own NMT system.

## Target Audience

- **Students of Translation or Humanities**: Gain insights into the inner workings of NMT and LLMs, equipping you with the knowledge to critically assess and engage with translation technologies.
- **Practicing Translators and Language Service Providers**: Understand the technological advancements shaping the industry and how they can be leveraged to enhance translation quality and efficiency.
- **Translation Technology Enthusiasts**: Explore the practicalities of NMT systems, from conceptualization to implementation, and learn how to evaluate MT outputs effectively.

## Repository Contents

This repository serves as a companion to the book, providing a range of resources that complement the concepts discussed:

- **Sample Code**: Experiment with real-life NMT model examples, understand their architecture, and learn how to tweak them for different translation tasks.
- **Datasets**: Access curated datasets ideal for training and testing NMT systems, along with guidance on how to use them effectively.
- **Tutorials and Guides**: Step-by-step instructions to get you started on building and evaluating your own NMT system, tailored for beginners and advanced users alike.
- **Additional Readings**: A collection of recommended articles, papers, and resources for further exploration into the subject matter.
