# adaptNMT

adaptNMT streamlines all processes involved in the development and deployment of RNN and Transformer neural translation models. As an open-source application, it is designed for both technical and non-technical users who work in the field of machine translation. Built upon the widely-adopted OpenNMT ecosystem, the application is particularly useful for new entrants to the field since the setup of the development environment and creation of train, validation  and test splits is greatly simplified. Graphing, embedded within the application, illustrates the progress of model training, and SentencePiece is used for creating subword segmentation models. Hyperparameter customization is facilitated through an intuitive user interface, and a single-click model development approach has been implemented. Models developed by adaptNMT can be evaluated using a range of metrics, and deployed as a translation service within the application. To support eco-friendly research in the NLP space, a green report also flags the power consumption and kgCO\textsubscript2 emissions generated during model development. The application is freely available.

# adaptLLM

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spawned innovation in many areas of Natural Language Processing. Despite the exciting potential of this technology, its impact on developing high-quality Machine Translation (MT) outputs for low-resource languages remains relatively under-explored. Furthermore, an open-source application, dedicated to both fine-tuning LLMs and managing the complete MT workflow, remains unavailable. We aim to address these imbalances through the development of adaptLLM which streamlines all processes involved in the fine-tuning of LLMs for MT. As an open-source application, it is designed for both technical and non-technical users who work in the field of MT. The application is particularly useful for new entrants to the field since the setup of the development environment is greatly simplified. Hyperparameter customization is facilitated through an intuitive user interface and models can be evaluated using a range of metrics and deployed as a translation service within the application. As a multilingual tool, we used adaptLLM to fine-tune models for two low-resource language pairs: English to Irish (EN↔GA) and English to Marathi (EN↔MR). Compared with baselines from the LoResMT2021 Shared Task, the adaptLLM system demonstrated significant improvements. In the EN→GA direction, an improvement of 5.2 BLEU points was observed and an increase of 40.5 BLEU points was recorded in the GA→EN direction representing relative improvements of 14% and 117% respectively. Significant improvements in the translation performance of the EN↔MR pair were also observed notably in the MR→EN direction with an increase of 21.3 BLEU points which corresponds to a relative improvement of 68%. Finally, a fine-grained human evaluation of the LLM output on the EN→GA pair was conducted using the Multi-dimensional Quality Metrics and Scalar Quality Metrics error taxonomies. The application and models are freely available.
